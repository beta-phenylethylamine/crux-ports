POST-INSTALL

  Since this isn't one of the "official" pinentry ports, it's not
  included in the list of alternatives in /usr/bin/pinentry, so to use it you
  must set the command for, for example, GnuPG yourself, which can be done by
  appending the following to ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf

    pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-tty
